(Buay) The main.cpp has the main includes such as core, keypad, size(for player), random for the dot
when it hits the player and some sprites for the game. This does not include the backdrop to set the

to the score.

Player speed is controlled by `SPEED`.

Player and treasure sizes are conrolled by `PLAYER_SIZE` and `TREASURE_SIZE`.
